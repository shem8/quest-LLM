          - text: Now that we've cracked the basics, let's talk architectureâ€”the Transformer architecture, to be exact. It's the beating heart of modern LLMs.
          - text: Transformers revolutionized language modeling by introducing self-attention mechanisms, allowing models to weigh the significance of different words in context.
          - text: This shift has made LLMs incredibly efficient and effective at handling complex language tasks.
          - text: Given its importance, think about how this architecture transforms language processing. How do you perceive its impact on language model development over traditional models like RNNs or LSTMs?
