          - text: LLMs typically rely on the Transformer architecture, a game-changer in
              neural network design.
          - text: Transformers utilize attention mechanisms to focus on parts of the input
              sequence, making them powerful for language processing tasks.
          - text: This architecture underpins models like BERT and the GPT family, both
              integral to generative and representational tasks.
